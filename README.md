### Project Notes: 
#### I included a stretch goal in my app and it was the use of two npm packages. I used faker and chalk to enhance my app. By using faker, I was able to generate information that was needed for my inventory when creating a flower. Then, I used chalk to add some color to the terminal. By using three colors, I am able to have corresponding colors depending on each statement outcome. Red was assigned to an error message while yellow was assigned to a warning message. Lastly, I used green to indicate a message that is deemed successful.
